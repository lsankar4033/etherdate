# TODO
- deploy webapp
  - make sure prod can load BirthdayCoin.json
    - (right now only lite-server works properly)
  - add prod http-server setup to package.json (and readme?)
- (optional) configurability of which net to connect to
- (optional) open source code?
  - instead could just include the ABI interface or something on the site
  - license it if so
