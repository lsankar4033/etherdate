# TODO
- webapp
  - UX guidance around tx times + withdrawal cost
  - organize the code so that I'm at least proud of it...
    - optional i guess
  - style so that everything fits nicely with padding, etc.
  - desc text
    - rebrand to datecoin?
  - display prices in eth
- configurability of which net to connect to
- deploy to mainnet + deploy webapp
  - may need to store ABI with codebase?
- open source code?
  - license it if so

# Webapp experience notes

Assume non-eth users stumble upon this.

I should give some basic guidance around:
- how ethereum transactions take some time. perhaps with a link that guides them to the transaction
  - maybe I should add in events so that js app can change state of page appropriately
- how this app works. the parameters of price increase/fees

# Marketing

I think I should release this thing anonymously at first. If people randomly use it (I can try growth-hacking
it in various ways), then I can consider putting my name on it.

Can always include it in personal portfolios, etc. without making it publicly known that I made it.
