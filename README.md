# TODO
- strategically buy a few coins to populate top10 list
- buy a domain name and set it up
- rename internal code to datecoin (from birthdaycoin)
- (optional) favicon?
- (optional) configurability of which net to connect to
- (optional) open source code?
  - instead could just include the ABI interface or something on the site
  - license it if so
