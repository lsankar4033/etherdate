# TODO
- things to include in V2
  - some UX improvements around metamask usage
    - modal if not configured to current network
      - and maybe some indication of which network we're connected to.
    - notice that metamask transaction takes some time to go through at top of page
    - listening on events? events for 'buy' happening and for withdraw happening
  - update index.html
    - refer to github
    - update gist reference
