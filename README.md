# TODO
- smart contracts
  - choosing pricing/fees
- webapp
  - guidance around tx times + withdrawal cost
  - organize the code so that I'm at least proud of it...
  - style so that everything fits nicely with padding, etc.
  - desc text
  - display prices in eth
- configurability of which net to connect to
- deploy to mainnet + deploy webapp

# Webapp experience notes

Assume non-eth users stumble upon this.

I should give some basic guidance around:
- how ethereum transactions take some time. perhaps with a link that guides them to the transaction
  - maybe I should add in events so that js app can change state of page appropriately
- how this app works. the parameters of price increase/fees
