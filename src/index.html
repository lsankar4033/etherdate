      <h3> What is this? </h3>
      <p>
        Etherdate is a smart contract living on the Ethereum blockchain that allows anyone to 'buy' a day of the
        year and associate a message with it. There's only one etherdate for each (Gregorian) calendar date
        (1/1 through 12/31, incl. 2/29).  To own an etherdate and post a message with it, you must buy it from
        the current owner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Date prices increase on a fixed schedule as described below, under the heading 'How does pricing work?'
      </p>

      <p>
        Source code for the contract is <a href="https://gist.github.com/lsankar4033/6612427117e29393f06f4f600600a353">here</a>
        (note that contract and methods refer to 'birthdays' instead of 'dates'. When I originally wrote/deployed it, I was
        planning on making this birthday-specific). Feel free to deploy your own version if you'd like.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contract itself lives <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x77daea587e4cdf2bfa7acaba72f01b3a97d108ea">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3> Why? </h3>
      <p>
        Mostly just curiosity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blockchains allow individuals to organize around memes quickly. Individual days of the year are the source
        of many memes that are an important part of our collective consciousness. Some examples are holidays,
        birthdays of notable people, and dates of significance for some organization (i.e. a nation).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think these sorts of memes are the source of massive cultural value. This project is an experiment to
        see what sorts of memes form around dates among the participants in the Ethereum blockchain.
      </p>
      <h3> How does pricing work? </h3>
      <p>
        Each date starts priced at 0.02 eth. Each time a date is bought, its price increases according to the
        following schedule:
      </p>
      <table class='table'>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td> 0.02 eth -> 0.32 eth </td>
            <td> 2x </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td> 0.32 eth -> 1.62 eth </td>
            <td> 1.5x </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td> 1.62 eth -> the moon </td>
            <td> 1.1x </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Of the price paid, 1% is absorbed as commission for keeping this site running, and a nominal amount
        is used to withdraw the eth from the contract (less than 0.005 eth at last count). The rest goes to the
        previous date owner.
      </p>
      <h3> How do I participate? </h3>
      <p>
        For most users, the easiest way is via a web browser and the <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>
        browser extension. Once you've transferred eth to your Metamask wallet, use the date selector above to
        select a date, enter your message, and buy it. The top 10 highest-priced dates show up in the 'Hall of Fame'
        above along with their messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that it will take some time for your transaction to be finalized in the Ethereum network.
      </p>

      <h3> Are dates worth anything? </h3>
      <p>
        Probably not, in all likelihood. If you think that a date has demand (and will be bought up) because it
        represents something people care about, go ahead and buy it, but realize that this is all for fun. Please
        don't spend money you can't afford to lose.
      </p>
